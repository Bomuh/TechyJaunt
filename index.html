                <h2>Impact of Social Media on Society:</h2>
                <img src="https://www.theasianschool.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog3.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Impact of Social Media on Society image">
                <p>The survey indicates that the public, when polled, believes that the internet and social media have significant effects on societies. Across the six issues examined, respondents generally acknowledge changes due to increased connectivity, expressing both positive and negative impacts simultaneously. Notably, a median of 84% expresses concern that technological connectivity has made individuals more susceptible to manipulation through false information and rumors, the highest among the issues explored. However, a substantial median of 73% believes that people have become more informed about both international and domestic current events.

                    Regarding politics, the internet and social media are perceived as disruptive, with a median of 65% stating that people are now more divided in their political opinions. A shared sentiment, held by a median of 44% across the surveyed countries, suggests that internet access and social media usage have led to a decline in civility when discussing politics. Despite this, a slightly higher median of 45% believes that connectivity has made people more accepting of diverse ethnicities, religions, and races, compared to those who feel it has made people less accepting (22%) or had no effect (29%). <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2022/12/06/views-of-social-media-and-its-impacts-on-society-in-advanced-economies-2022/", target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

                <img src="https://i0.wp.com/kashmirreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Thrilling-odyssey-of-space-exploration.jpg?fit=624%2C415&ssl=1" style="width:100%;" alt="Space Exploration and Discoveries image">
                <p>The timeline of space exploration highlights significant milestones, starting with the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial Earth satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957. Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space in 1961, and within a decade, American astronauts landed on the Moon during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Subsequent Apollo missions saw a total of 12 Americans walking on the lunar surface by 1972. Since then, humans have not ventured beyond Earth orbit, but over 500 individuals have spent substantial time in space.

                    In the 1970s, Soviet and U.S. space stations, Skylab, and space shuttle flights facilitated human activities and research in Earth's orbit. The International Space Station (ISS), operational since 2000, has served as a permanent space base until at least 2024.
                    
                    Earth-orbiting satellites and robotic spacecraft have provided crucial data about the Sun, Earth, and celestial bodies. Robotic missions have landed on various celestial bodies, including the Moon, Venus, Mars, Titan, comets, and asteroids. Scientists leverage space-derived data to enhance understanding of cosmic phenomena, from galaxies to planetary evolution.
                    
                    Satellites in orbit play vital roles in everyday life, delivering meteorological information, remotely sensing Earth's surface for resource management and climate study, and enabling global telecommunications. Navigation satellites operated by various countries offer precise positioning and timing information crucial for terrestrial users, including the military. The benefits of space activities have led to the development of space programs by numerous countries, expanding beyond the initial efforts of the Soviet Union and the United States. By the 21st century, over 50 countries had active space agencies or government bodies engaged in space exploration and research. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/space-exploration/Major-milestones", target="_blank">Read more</a></p>

                <h2>Mental Health Awareness:</h2>
                <img src="https://www.fmchealth.org/app/uploads/2022/04/Mental-health-awareness-brain-tree-graphic-725x484.png" style="width:100%;" alt="Mental Health Awareness image">
                <p>Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development.

                    Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes.
                    
                    Mental health conditions include mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities as well as other mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning, or risk of self-harm. People with mental health conditions are more likely to experience lower levels of mental well-being, but this is not always or necessarily the case. <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-strengthening-our-response/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAmNeqBhD4ARIsADsYfTdIS1coA7W_OhAoZMMafm9sFDKhrEnM1Fm4f8-Cjfc5bmD7Zz136fgaAlQuEALw_wcB", target="_blank">Read more</a></p>
